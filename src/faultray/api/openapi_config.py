        "- Run thousands of chaos scenarios against your declared infrastructure model\n"
        "- 5 simulation engines (Cascade, Dynamic, Ops, What-If, Capacity)\n"
        "- 3-Layer Availability Limit Model (model-based estimate)\n"
        "- Cost impact analysis with illustrative ROI calculations\n"
        "- Research-prototype mappings to SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI DSS / DORA frameworks (not audit-certified)\n"
