"""CLI package for FaultRay.

Re-exports the Typer ``app`` so that ``faultray.cli:app`` keeps working as the
entry-point defined in pyproject.toml.  Submodules register their commands by
importing ``app`` from :mod:`faultray.cli.main` at import time.

Command modules are discovered and loaded lazily: they are imported the first
time the CLI is actually invoked (not at ``import`` time).  If a single command
module has a bug, other commands still work — the broken module is skipped with
a warning.
