"""Cascade rules - defines how failures propagate between components.

Formal Specification
--------------------
This module implements the **Cascade Propagation Semantics (CPS)**, a Labeled
Transition System (LTS) formally defined in:

    docs/patent/cascade-formal-spec.md

The CPS state is a 4-tuple ``S = (H, L, T, V)`` where:

- ``H: Component -> HealthStatus`` — health map
- ``L: Component -> float``        — accumulated latency map (ms)
- ``T: float``                     — elapsed time (seconds)
- ``V: set[Component]``            — visited (monotonically growing) set

Key proven properties (see formal spec Section 3):

1. **Monotonicity** — health can only worsen during a simulation run.
2. **Causality** — a component fails only if a dependency has failed.
3. **Circuit Breaker Correctness** — CB trip stops cascade at that edge.
4. **Termination** — CPS terminates in O(|V| + |E|) for acyclic graphs;
   depth limit D_max (default 20, configurable) guarantees termination for cyclic graphs.

        - Rule 2 (single replica): Required dep with upstream DOWN and
          ``failed.replicas == 1`` -> DOWN (with timeout dt).  A
          singleton upstream is fully unavailable; no redundancy exists
          to absorb the failure, so the cascade is hard.
        - Rule 2b (soft escape): weight <= 0.1 -> DEGRADED.  Soft
          required edges model best-effort / fallback-ready calls
          (retry-budget absorbed, circuit-broken, cached last-known-
          good), so they do not propagate a hard failure.
        - Rule 3 (multiple replicas): Required dep with upstream DOWN
          and ``failed.replicas > 1`` -> DEGRADED.  When the upstream
          has multiple replicas, remaining replicas can absorb load at
          reduced capacity; the dependent is degraded but not failed.
        - Rule 4: Optional dep, upstream DOWN -> DEGRADED (10s delay).
        - Rule 5: Async dep, upstream DOWN -> DEGRADED; propagation is
          delayed by the edge latency τ (ms → s) in addition to the 60s
          base, modelling queue/event-bus propagation lag.  Non-DOWN
          upstream does not cascade.
        - Rule 6: Non-DOWN upstream (DEGRADED/OVERLOADED) -> latency-
          driven degradation on the dependent.

        ``edge_latency_ms`` is used by Rule 5 (async) to advance the
        simulation time T by τ, differentiating delayed async propagation
        from the immediate optional propagation of Rule 4.
