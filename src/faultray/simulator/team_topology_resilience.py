"""Team Topology Resilience Analyzer.

Analyzes how team structure affects infrastructure resilience using
Conway's Law principles.  Maps team ownership to infrastructure
components, detects ownership gaps, cognitive overload, bus-factor
risks, and incident-response coverage gaps.

Based on the Team Topologies model (Skelton & Pais):
  - Stream-aligned teams
  - Platform teams
  - Enabling teams
  - Complicated-subsystem teams
