# Quick Start

Get FaultRay up and running in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install faultray
```

## Step 2: Generate a sample model

The `quickstart` command creates a sample infrastructure model and runs a basic simulation:

```bash
faultray quickstart
```

This generates an `infrasim-model.json` file in your current directory containing a sample multi-tier web application architecture.

## Step 3: Run a simulation

```bash
faultray simulate -m infrasim-model.json
```

FaultRay will run 150+ failure scenarios against your model and produce a resilience report showing:

- Overall resilience score (0-100)
- Single points of failure (SPOFs)
- Cascade failure risks
- Availability ceiling estimates

## Step 4: View the report

Generate an HTML report for detailed visualization:

```bash
faultray report -m infrasim-model.json -o report.html
```

Open `report.html` in your browser to see an interactive resilience dashboard.

## Step 5: Scan real infrastructure (optional)

If you have cloud credentials configured, scan your actual infrastructure:

```bash
# AWS
faultray scan --provider aws --output my-infra.json

# Kubernetes
faultray scan --provider k8s --output my-k8s.json

# Terraform
faultray tf-import --dir ./terraform --output my-tf.json
```
